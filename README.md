# CMSC312OSsimulator
This is an Operating Simulator made for my class CMSC 312 at VCU

# Installation
There is a runnable jar in the root of the project. Make sure that the jar is in the same folder as the Process Templates folder since thatâ€™s where it grabs the templates from. As for java version the jar was made with the Java 17 development kit so make sure that Java 17 is downloaded. JDK 17 can be found here https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/

For compiling I used intellij gui builder to make the gui so there is a .form but I dont fully understand the way it works so whatever dependecies is needed for that you will need If you use intellij to compile it it should work. The JDK I used was JDK 17

# Usage
 There is a start/stop button at the button along with a add button with two text fields
 
 The first of which is the number of processes to add to the os
 
 The second is the template you want to generate these processes from right now there is only 6 templates 1-6
 
 1 - short running calculate heavy process
 
 2 - calculate heavy process with critical section
 
 3 - balanced process
 
 4 - calculate heavy process
 
 5 - long calculate heavy process with critical section
 
 6 - i/o heavy process

 7 - a copy of the template 1 but with a fork in the middle
 
 
 
 The average turnaround time is shown at the bottom with the average wait time which is displayed in seconds for scheduler 1 and 2 respectively

 Next to this is memory for each scheduler they both have 1024 in memory each process has a randomly generated amount of memory that they take up
 
 Each process will show its number/pid, state, and remaining cycles until it is terminated where it will then show its turnaround time in seconds
 
 The simulator can be started and stopped via the start/stop button.
 
 The three section of list is split into ready list, waiting, and all the processes.

# Documentation

Class: Scheduler

    Constructor: public Scheduler(ProcessList l, MainGUI m)
      Desc: This creates the scheduler object which extends a thread so it acts as a runnable thread
    Method: public void setExit(boolean e)
      Desc: This will set the boolean exit to the given boolean e
    Method: public void run()
      Desc: This is the main loop of the class this will while exit is not true run a scheduler algorithm on the list of processes from the class 
      processlist the scheduler algo that it is running as of now is round robin it will try to run at 20 CPU cycles per 2 milliseconds it will call the updateProcess method
      and pass the current process along to it
    Method: public void updateProcesses(ProcessList.Process p, int i)
      Desc: the method will update the current process depending on the state that it is in and it will assign the process to a thread if it is ready to be ran
    Method: public void assignThread(ProcessList.Process p)
      Desc: this method will assign the given process to a thread that is currently not running
    Method: public void setSemaphore(int i)
      Desc: sets the semaphore to i
    Method: public void setRunningProc(int i)
      Desc: sets the runningProc to i
    Method: public int getSemaphore()
      Desc: returns the semaphore
    Method: public int getRunningProc()
      Desc: returns the runningProc
    Method: public ProcessList getPCB()
      Desc: returns the ProcessList list
Class: Scheduler2
    
    Constructor: public Scheduler(ProcessList l, MainGUI m)
      Desc: This creates the scheduler object which extends a thread so it acts as a runnable thread
    Method: public void setExit(boolean e)
      Desc: This will set the boolean exit to the given boolean e
    Method: public void run()
      Desc: This is the main loop of the class this will while exit is not true run a scheduler algorithm on the list of processes from the class 
      processlist the scheduler algo that it is running Shortest remaining time and it will keep checking for the lowest remaining time process to run
  
Class: ProcessList
		
		Constructor: public ProcessList()
			Desc: creates a list for processes, the count of processes, and a list for terminated processes
		Method: public void generateProcesses(int count, int temp)
			Desc: generates a given number of processes of a given template number and adds them to the process list
		Method: public List<Process> getList()
			Desc: returns the list of processes
		Method: public List<Process> getTerminatedList()
			Desc: returns the list of terminated processes
		Method: public Process getProcess(int n)
			Desc: returns the process at given location n from the process list
		Method: public void removeProcess(int n)
			Desc: removes the process at location n in the process list
		
		Class: Task
			
			Constructor: public Task(String name, int t, int m)
				Desc: the constructor for the task object that takes in a name, time, and memory of the task
			Method: public int getTime()
				Desc: Returns the time/cycles of the task
			Method: public void setTime(int t)
				Desc: sets the time/cycles of the task to the int t
			Method: public int getMemory()]
				Desc: returns the memory of the task
			Method: public String getTaskName()
				Desc: returns the name of the task
				
		Class: Process
			
			Constructor: public Process(int tempNum, int num)
				Desc: Constructor for the process class that takes in the template number for the process and the number of the process also generates the tasks for the process
			Method: private void generateTasks(int tempNum)
				Desc: generates a task from the template number then uses the file for the template to make all the tasks from it
			Method: public void setArrivalTime(long n)
				Desc: sets the arrival time of the process in milliseconds with the given long n
			Method:public void setCompletionTime(long n)
				Desc: set the completion time of the process in milliseconds with the given long n
			Method:public long getTurnAroundTime()
				Desc: returns the turnaround time in milliseconds of the process which is completion time - arrival time
			Method:public long getWaitTime()
				Desc: returns the wait time of the process in milliseconds which is turnaround time - burst time
			Method:public int getTotalMem()
				Desc: returns the remaining memory of the process
			Method:public int getTotalCycles()
				Desc: returns the remaining cycles of the process
			Method:public Task getCurrentTask()
				Desc: returns the current task of the process
			Method:public boolean nextTask()
				Desc: return true if there is a next task and moves to it returns false if there is no next task
			Method:public void updateState(String newState)
				Desc: updates the state of the process to the string newState
			Method:public String getState()
				Desc: returns the state of the process
			Method:public int getNumber()
				Desc: returns the number of the process
Class: Threads
    
    Constructor: public Threads()
        Desc: This is the default constructor it sets all variables to null or 0
    Constructor: public Threads(ProcessList l, ProcessList.Process p, int c, Scheduler s)
        Desc: this sets the list to l, proc to p, cycles to c, and scheduler to s
    Method: public void run()
        Desc: this is the main run method for the thread it will take the given process and to calculate task until it reaches the end of the given cycles it also has a 1 in 10 chance to cause an io interrupt
